        Over the past decade we have accumulated debts to more people than can
        be named here.
      </p>

        This project would not have gotten off the ground without Terry (T. K.)
        Pratt and David Friend, formerly of Nelson Education. They took the idea
        of revising DCHP‑1 to the Canadian linguistic community in January 2005,
        explored first steps and helped with both encouragement and dollars in
        its first years.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to thank Laurel Brinton for her reliable assistance, her
        support and active work on DCHP‑1 Online and the Bank of Canadian
        English from 2006 to 2012. Without her, DCHP‑2 would not have had the
        smooth start at UBC that it had. Two Heads of English were especially
        important for the project: Gernot Wieland, who provided a project office
        at the heart of the English department on Buchanan Tower's 3rd floor,
        and Dennis Danielson, who gave the project a research assistant when
        funding was hard to come by. Over the years, too many colleagues at UBC
        English to be named individually have offered general encouragement,
        critique and information on select terms; one of them, Elizabeth
        Hodgson, stands out in more than one respect. We would like to thank
        John Considine, champion of lexicography and Canadian English alike, who
        in 2008 provided us the perfect venue to present our ideas to the
        academic peers at his Edmonton conference. Kiel University's Matthias L.
        G. Meyer and is owed thanks for his general support over the years,
        including the chief editors' Canadian Studies Guest Professorship in the
        summer of 2012. Jutta Zimmermann for inviting the project to the 2013
        Gesellschaft für Kanada-Studien Conference in Grainau, Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have received advice and help from a number of colleagues. The
        members of the Advisory Committee, J. K. Chambers, Sandra Clarke, David
        Friend and Terry Pratt, were important for the early stages of the
        project. We wish to thank Janice McAlpine of the Strathy Language Unit
        for transcribing, with Tara Downs, Yanush Sierra, and Michelle Chu, 5000
        quotation slips collected by Walter S. Avis between the publication of
        DCHP‑1 and 1979, and a further 650 quotation slips collected by Helen
        MacDonald from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. We especially thank
        the late Ms Faith Avis for allowing us to use her late husband's
        unpublished research material. Chris Hives and Leslie Fields from the
        UBC University Archives provided a scanned version of DCHP‑1, which
        became the base for our digitization project DCHP‑1 Online.

        We had the good fortune to work with many gifted software programmers.
        In 2007, UBC Arts IT analyst Usman Khan set up the first structure for
        data entry that we used for class assignments, while Matthew Grew
        evolved that database into the Bank of Canadian English. Anne Condon and
        Kurt Eiselt at UBC Computer Science allowed us to benefit from project
        work in the latter's Computer Science Software Engineering class in
        2008. The class programming team members are thanked for lending their
        expertise and dedication for what seemed like an easy project only at
        first glance, but soon revealed its challenges: Yanik Berube, Taivo
        Evard, Frank Hangler, David Kennedy, Stephanie Kuo, Cindy Lai, Cindy
        Shih, Kyu-Eun Lee, Jonathan Ng, Sha Xiao and Yian Chen. Between 2008 and
        2012, Frank Hangler and David Kennedy continued to expand the Dictionary
        Editing Tool, and tweak the Bank of Canadian English. This complex task
        was taken on in 2012 by Jeremy Hewett, then an MA student in Computer
        Science, who remained with us until the conclusion of the project.
      </p>

        We thank Janice Schoening, VP Publications at Nelson Education, for
        granting permission to make DCHP‑1 Online open access and, importantly,
        for allowing us to adapt DCHP‑1 content as we saw fit for DCHP‑2;
        Michelle Kelly, Kevin Martindale and, especially, Joe Banel and Terry
        Pratt are thanked for aiding in the process. UBC's Office of University
        Council's' Kimberley Back assisted with forging a licence agreement with
        Nelson Education, while Georg Daniel Reuter from Richards Buell Sutton
        LLP worked with the editor-in-chief and Nelson to find the right
        wording. While our original plan to use a Creative Commons license was
        legally not possible, we are glad to be able to offer DCHP-2 in open
        access for everyone to enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We express our thanks to Joanne Proulx, Team Leader of SSRHC Awards
        Administration, for allowing SSHRC funding to continue during the
        project's final year while the Principal Investigator, while on leave
        from UBC, was working in Sweden. SSHRC program officer Terry Lee
        McPherson and especially Edmund Gin at UBC Finance are owed thanks for
        making accessible the funding in the project's last year (2015-16).
      </p>

        We were fortunate to work with so many talented and hard-working
        students. Stefan Dollinger's courses on practical historical
        lexicography between 2007 and 2012 exposed some 500 UBC students to
        Canadian English lexicography. Their work not only enriched the Bank of
        Canadian English; these classes also became the recruitment pool for our
        academic research assistants, 29 of them over the years:
      </p>
      <p>
        Caitlin Bethune, Emily Briggs, Faerie Cabrera, Sam Chung, Cicily Cooper,
        Jona Dervishaj, Mark Douglas, Baillie Ford, Alexandra Gaylie, David
        Haist, Jocelyn Hassel, Javier Ibanez, Laura Kuboniwa, Breanna Laing,
        Kendi Lam, Gabrielle Lim, Adrienne Lee, Emma Lee, Katrina Lo, Molika
        Loshi, Helen Lui, Margarita Manabat, Izabela Moldovan, Emily
        Sadlier-Brown, Jimmy Shaw, Lindsey Shin, Hanami Shirai, David
        Stansfield, Jessica Tam, Evgenia Todorova, Phoebe Wong, Frank Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to all of them for turning Buchanan Tower 328 into a productive,
        pleasant, if at times slightly over-crowded, workplace. Special thanks
        are owed to our volunteers in the Canadian English Lab:
      </p>
      <p>
        Christine Barker, Damon Barta, Baillie Ford, Sheldon Goldfarb, Ashley
        Gonzalez, Anna Martič, Izabela Moldovan, Matthew Parisien, Geoff Roeder,
        Diane Singleton.
      </p>

        Proofreader Nancy Tinari joined the project only in February 2016 but
        is, apart from the editors, the only person who has read all entries and
        frontmatter text. Her care went beyond the call of duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        When funds were depleted in late August 2016, Nancy Tinari, Baillie Ford
        and Jeremy Hewett volunteered their services to ensure maximum
        consistency over all entries, for which we express our most sincere
        thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of colleagues answered questions pertaining to select lexical
        items, meanings or other issues, or joined our panel of consultants:
      </p>
      <p>
        Joan C. Beal, Charles Boberg, , Charles Boberg, J. K. Chambers,
        Rose-Marie Déchaine, Elaine Gold, Joan Hall, William A. Kretzschmar,
        Eric Mathieu, Kevin McCafferty, Leslie Monkman, T. K. Pratt, Jeff
        Prucher, Yves Roberge, Ray Siemens, Herbert Schendl, Luanne von
        Schneidemesser, Mireille Tremblay, Martina Wiltschko, William Winder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Special thanks are owed to Sandra Clarke and her colleagues at Memorial
        University, for important help with the complex question of
        Newfoundlandisms and two “both Sandras”, Sandra Clarke and Sandra Power,
        and Philip Hiscock for assisting with select Newfoundland entries.
      </p>
      <p>
        UBC campus is on traditional, ancestral and unceded Indigenous lands and
        it is on these lands that most of DCHP-2 was produced. Daniel Heath
        Justice is thanked for reading drafts of some two dozen entries of
        special interest to First Nations questions in detail and for generously
        offering advice on how to consider and reflect on the colonial heritage
        of DCHP. While all remaining mistakes remain our own, Daniel has helped
        us avoid the one or the other mistake: wado (thank you in Cherokee).
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from these researchers, we contacted a great many individuals over
        the years with requests for help on a given aspect: linguists and
        language lovers, book authors, bloggers, librarians, archivists,
        journalists, or simply interested members of the public. All errors, in
        all cases in which we benefitted from somebody else's expertise and
        generosity, remain entirely our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also owe a debt of gratitude to a number of institutions. Thanks must
        go to UBC’s Department of English for providing office space since
        January 2008 and for support in general; to UBC’s Faculty of Arts for
        four Arts Undergraduate Research Awards (AURA) (2008, 2009, 2010,
        2012-13) and one HSS Award (2009); the Dictionary Society of North
        America for awarding the 2007 Laurence-Urdang DSNA Award to the project;
        the Philologisch-Kulturwissenschaftliche Fakultät of the University of
        Vienna for early project seed funding; and the University of Vienna
        Office of International Relations for funding a postdoctoral position
        for Stefan Dollinger in 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, who
        supported the DCHP project with three Standard Research/Insight Grants
        (2007-2010 [Brinton and Fee grant# 410-2007-2215], 2010-11 [Dollinger,
        Brinton, Fee grant #410-2011-97] and 2013-16 [Dollinger grant
        #435-2013-0233.]). These funding sources combined allowed us to
        consistently employ an undergraduate workforce for over eight years for
        a total of almost 11,500 remunerated student work hours (see Project
        Team). We owe special thanks to Nelson Education for funding two project
        meetings, one in Toronto in 2006 and one in Vancouver in 2007, for
        reference book purchases and for supporting Stefan Dollinger’s
        exploratory archival research in early 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we wish to thank the members of the public who responded to our
        questionnaires, media reports and solicitation for potential
        Canadianisms.
